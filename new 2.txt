93k transcripts
100 base pair read
assign a probability that it came from one of those transcripts

break 100 into 70 31-mers
31-mer as an input
keep "31" flexible

every 5-mer (1024), CNN takes 1024 inputs
There can be 27 different 5-mers in the 31-mer
Learn a set of weights for wi from 0-1023
Learn a sigmoid 
We'll pick ~35 kernels (arbitrary number again)

Layer 1:
1024 inputs
2D input of 1024 rows and 70 columns

Layer 2:
Fully connected to layer 1
MaxPool over 70 of bunches of 5 and take the highest of the kernel outputs and has 14 inputs for each of the 35 kernels
35*14 = 490 outputs from the 1024 inputs of layer 1
Gets 35*70 positions = ~2500

Layer 3:
500 inputs from the previous layer

All of the above fully connected

Layer 5:
90k nodes which take 500 inputs which together have a softmax activation
